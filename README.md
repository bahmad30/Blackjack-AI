BlackjackAI is user-playable Blackjack along with an integrated AI with simulation capabilities, all written in C++. There are two ways to interact with this project:

1) The user can play Blackjack with betting on each round, and recieved card-by-card "go-bust" probabilities along with an AI-recommended move.

2) The user can run simulations of 1,000, 10,000, and 100,000 rounds using the AI's picks, and view the AI's performance statistics after each simulation including the win percentage, most wins in a row, and betting profit.

To run this project, you must have Cinder (the graphics library) installed.

This project is entirely made by Bilaal Ahmad.
