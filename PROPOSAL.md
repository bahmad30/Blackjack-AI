I want to make a blackjack AI for my final project.
Specifically, I want to implement the card game blackjack
in Cinder, and then add an AI component that predicts
the best move a player should make given the cards in play.
I also want to make a money component where the user
starts with an initial balance and can bet however 
much money they want on a round, and win/lose money as
a result. I also want to add a component where the
computer can run a simulation for several rounds using
only the AI's picks.

I want to do this project for a few reasons. First off, 
I like using statistics/probability in conjunction with 
programming. Blackjack is a great game for this, because
one can predict how likely a player is to receive a card
that will make them win/lose given the cards on the table
relatively easily. I also like programs that are able to 
simulate or predict things in general. Also, I like 
blackjacks and other betting card games.

By the end of week 1, my goal is to have implemented the
actual game of blackjack. This means I want to make the cards
and have them displayed on the screen, make a function that
shuffles/randomizes the deck, make rounds reset when the user
wins or loses, and allow the user to provide input that allows
them to play. By the end of week 2, I would like to finish the
predictive/AI component of this project. This means I want to 
make a function that predicts the likelihood of a player
winning/losing based on the two possible moves in blackjack
by calculating the probability of a winning/losing card
showing up, and displays it on the screen. Also, depending 
on how long this takes, I would like to start working on 
the money component during week 2. For week 3, I want to 
finish the money/betting component, and add the simulation
component. This means the user will be able to provide
input that allows them run x amount of rounds using the AI's
picks. The success of these picks will be displayed via a
win/lose percentage over time.

If I am able to finish all this, I might add a component
to the AI where it is able to bet a certain amount of 
money based on the confidence of each of its picks. My
other stretch goals would include some sort of reflection
on the AI's performance, and maybe some more visual and 
gameplay changes that make the game more playable/aesthetic.
